## My UX Projects - *homegrown*

### The Purpose
Life is busy and plants suffer when forgotten, so *homegrown* provides that necessary reminder when our green friends need a little care and attention. 

### Brainstorming
I tried to come up with other ideas but the only ones that really sparked interest were to do with plants so I figured out what the hardest thing for me to remember about owning plants is and came up with *homegrown* as a result.

### Discovery Phases
After coming up with a basic idea and getting user feedback on that idea, I started sketching out the ideas in my head about my website, each sketch realizing more of what I wanted *homegrown* to look like. Here are a few examples:

After completing sketches for every page I thought the website needed, I created a mind map to delve into what I wanted users to feel when using *homegrown*

I also designed a color pallete that I thought matched well with the feeling of the site, and what it was meant to accomplish.

Before creating my prototype, I wrote an enormous planning document and went through each sketch to write down pages I needed as well as any extra pages I thought of. After I was satisfied with that, I created wireframes for each page.

After finishing the wireframes, I moved on to creating a high-functioning prototype in Adobe XD. This allowed me to concretely visualize the website without having to reorganize and edit code each time I wanted to make a big change. Below is how I organized all the different pages that were connected through Adobe XD's prototyping tools.

Now that I had a working prototype, I sent the prototype to potential users and got their feedback. This was my favorite part of the process as I got to see others interact with what I'd worked so hard on. I enjoyed hearing what they liked, what they didn't, and suggestions for different features the site could have. 
Overall, their opinions of *homegrown* were positive, which I was very glad of.
