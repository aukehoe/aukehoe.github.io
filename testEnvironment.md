# My UX Projects - The Great Purge

## The Purpose
When myself and my fellow intern started our new job on the same day, we were thrown into a whirlpool of confusing code with poor documentation as well as a complicated site that the code was written to test on. This particular test environment was the product of several years and different groups of interns. So we set out to redo the code architecture of the project so that we and all other interns to come after us would be able to navigate the project and add to it with relative ease. 

## Brainstorming
My fellow intern and I sat down with our lunches (we knew it would take a while) and began to break down what we knew about the project, what needed to stay, and what could be purged. Over the course of a few sandwiches, we were able to get basic architecture sketched out based on what we knew so that we would have a solid case for refactoring the test environment to present to our manager. 

## Discovery Phases
We brought out huge markerboards so we could sketch out the different sections that the code could fit into as well as some basic file structure so that the test cases could be better organized. 

We were able to purge all the old code and introduce better organization structure to the project as well as standardize comments added to the code to be more descriptive and useful to those reading the code, especially if they had not written it. 

I did not know what the usability heuristics were at the time of completing this project. However, I can successfully say that we introduced the following heuristics into the project
  -	Consistency and standard: by standardizing how code was written with distinct patterns for each type of test and file, we introduced order to an enormous project. 
  -	Recognition rather than recall: by creating standard patterns, code will be exactly where you expect it to be instead of searching the entire project for a file or test step
  -	Flexibility and efficiency of use: the project became much more efficient to use because we purged all extraneous code
  -	Aesthetic and minimalist design: while this project did not have a distinct user interface, by making the entire project cleaner, it looked much prettier and the user could easily figure out where everything they needed was.
  -	Help and documentation: in addition to purging and reorganizing the project itself, we updated the project's Wiki on our company's GitLab to reflect all the changes we made and to formally document the standards we established so that all users following us will know how to match what we did. (Or improve it, should the need arise!)

Due to security concerns, I cannot share images of the code we refactored or the file architecture. Despite that, this project is one of the projects I am most proud of. When my internship comes to an end, I will be proud to leave behind what we did in confidence that we left it better than we found it.
