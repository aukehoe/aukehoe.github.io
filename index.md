## Thanks for visiting my portfolio! - Aurora Kehoe

### About Me
I'm Aurora Kehoe and I grew up in the mountains in the middle of a very beautiful nowhere. I grew up reading books in various corners around the house or gamboling about the foothills near my house without much access to the internet or video games. I realized that I had an affinity for computers once I got a laptop for high school. I took a coding class in my last year of high school and that started me on a journey that I continue to explore now. Growing up in a family that held art in a place of high importance has helped me view my code and projects I contribute to with a discerning eye that aids in making it cleaner and friendlier to those who use it after me.
